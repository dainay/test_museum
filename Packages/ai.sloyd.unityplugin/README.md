# Sloyd AI - Generate 3D - Plugin for Unity  

**Customizable models made by humans. Assembled and stylized by AI.**  

---  

## Overview  
The **Sloyd AI Plugin for Unity** allows users to generate 3D objects from simple text prompts and iteratively edit them with additional text commands. Sloyd stands out by producing game-ready 3D models with clean topology in just seconds. These models are composed of separate parts, making them easy to modify for your specific needs.  

### Features  
- **Text-based 3D Generation**: Create 3D objects quickly using a simple text description.  
- **Iterative Editing**: Refine objects through intuitive text commands.  
- **Game-Ready Models**: Generated models feature clean topology and are ready for immediate use in your game.  
- **Modular Design**: Objects are created from separate parts, ensuring ease of customization.

## How to Use  
1. **Open the Sloyd Plugin**:  
   - In Unity, navigate to **Window** and select **Sloyd Plugin**.  

2. **Enter Your Credentials**:  
   - Paste the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** obtained from the Sloyd web app.  

3. **Generate a 3D Object**:  
   - In the **AI Prompt** field, provide a short text description of the object you want to generate.  
   - If Sloyd can generate it, the object will spawn in your Unity scene.  

4. **Edit Objects with AI**:  
   - In the **Hierarchy** tab, click on the root level of the created object.  
   - In the **Inspector**, find the **Edit with AI** text field.  
   - Type a simple text request to modify the object (e.g., change dimensions, add/remove details).  
   - If the change is successful, the modified object will replace the old one in the scene.  
   - Both the new and old versions will be saved in the **Asset Folder** for reference.  

5. **Runtime Usage**
- You can also expose Sloyd's AI prompting and editing in playmode and have players of your game or application create with Sloyd.
   - Call `SloydSceneObject.Create()` to request creating a 3D model. The method has two parameters:
    - required **string** `prompt`
    - and optional **SloydClientAPI.PromptModifier** `modifier`:
      - If you want to get an AI textured model, pass `SloydClientAPI.PromptModifier.Texturing`.
      - For recognition coloring instructions in your prompt by AI, pass `SloydClientAPI.PromptModifier.ReColoring`.
      - If you skip `modifier` argument or pass `SloydClientAPI.PromptModifier.None`, a 3D model will be painted with its default palette colors.
   - Note the method is asynchronous. 
```csharp
SloydSceneObject sceneObject = await SloydSceneObject.Create(textPrompt, SloydClientAPI.PromptModifier.Texturing);
```
- **SloydSceneObject** is a **MonoBehaviour** component attached to each spawned model. Call `SloydSceneObject.Edit()` to request editing a spawned 3D model with another prompt.
   - Note the method is asynchronous.
```csharp
await sceneObject.Edit(textPrompt);
```
